### üöÄ Enhancements

  - **crypto:** Add support for webcrypto and node crypto The code adds support for both webcrypto and node crypto. Two new files, crypto.node.ts and crypto.web.ts, are added to the project. The crypto.node.ts file exports the node crypto module, while the crypto.web.ts file exports the webcrypto module. The exported modules are then used in the main crypto.ts file to provide a consistent interface for both web and node environments. ([291db64](https://github.com/nyxblabs/cryptonyx/commit/291db64))
